HPE 3PAR volume plug-in for Docker: Create help
Create a volume in HPE 3PAR or create a clone of a docker volume or create a snapshot of a docker volume using HPE 3PAR volume plug-in for Docker.
Default Options:
-o mountConflictDelay=x 	x is the number of seconds to delay a mount request when there is a conflict(default is 30)
-o size=x 			x is a size of a docker volume to be created, default value of x is 100 (in GiB)
-o provisioning=x 		x is a provision type of a volume to be created, valid values are thin,dedup,full. Default value is thin.


Create Volume Options:
 -o cpg=x                       x is the Usr CPG used for provisioning the volume
 -o snapcpg=x                   x is the Snap CPG used for provisioning the snapshots of the volume
 -o size=x 			x is a size of a docker volume to be created, deault value of x is 100 (in GiB)
 -o provisioning=x 		x is a provision type of a volume to be created, valid values are thin,dedup,full. Default value is thin.
 -o compression=x 		x is a boolean value, hence x can have true or false. To create a compressed volume, minimum size of a 
				volume should to be 16 GiB. It also requires 3PAR OS version 3.3.1 or more and underlying disks should be SSD.
 -o flash-cache=x 		x is a boolean value, hence x can have true or false. x specifies whether flash cache should be used or not.
				Valid vaues are true or false.
 -o qos-name=x 			x is name of existing VVset on 3PAR on which QoS rules are applied.
 -o fsOwner=x                    x is the user id and group id that should own the root directory of the filesystem, in the form of     
                                [userId:groupId]
 -o fsMode=x                     x is 1 to 4 octal digits that represent the file mode to be applied to the root directory of the
                                filesystem
 -o replicationGroup=x 	        x is name of the 3PAR replication group to which the newly created volume is added. If the replication
                                group doesn't exist on 3PAR array then it is created. Configuration parameter, 'replication_device',
                                must be defined in the hpe.conf file in conjunction with this option. Not doing so results in rejection
                                of the volume creation request. Another configuration parameter, 'quorum_witness_ip', if defined, results
                                into Peer Persistence based replication configuration. Absence of 'quorum_witness_ip' results into
                                Active/Passive based replication configuration.



Create Clone Options:
 -o cloneOf=x			x is the name of docker volume (source volume) of which clone to be created.
 -o size=x 			x is the size of cloned volume. x should be greater than or equal to size of a source volume.
 -o cpg=x                       x is the Usr CPG used for provisioning the volume
 -o snapcpg=x                   x is the Snap CPG used for provisioning the snapshots of the volume

 
Create Snapshot Options:
 -o virtualCopyOf=x		x is the name of a docker volume for which snapshot/virtual copy is to be created.
 -o retentionHours=x 		x is the number of hours a snapshot will be retained. Snapshot will be retained for x hours from the time of creation.
                                Snapshot can not be deleted during retention period.
 -o expirationHours=x		x is the number of hours after which snapshot will be removed from 3PAR. If both retentionHours and expirationHours 
				are used then expirationHours must be greater than or equal to retentionHours.

Import Volume Options:
 -o importVol=x                 x is the name of 3PAR volume or snapshot which needs to be imported. Volume or snapshot which needs to be imported
                                should not be attached to any of the host.


Create Snapshot Schedule:
 -o virtualCopyOf=x             This option is mandatory. x is the name of the volume for which snapshot schedule has to be created.
 -o scheduleFrequency=x         This option is mandatory. x is the string that indicates the snapshot schedule frequency.
                                This string will contain 5 values which are seperated by space.
                                Example x can be replaced with "5 * * * *"
