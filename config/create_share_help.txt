HPE 3PAR Share Plug-in For Docker: Create Help
===============================================
Create a share in HPE 3PAR using HPE 3PAR volume plug-in for Docker.

-o filePersona          Presence of this flag allows the File Persona driver to process the request
-o fpg=x                  x is the name of the file provisioning group (FPG). This option must be specified when user wants
                            to use a non-default FPG or a legacy FPG. The FPG may or may not be an existing one.
                            For a non-existing FPG x, a new FPG is created using the CPG that is either explicitly
                            specified with '-o cpg' option or configured in hpe.conf.
                            If FPG exists, be it a legacy FPG or Docker managed FPG, share is simply created under it.
                            In case this option is not specified, then a default FPG is created with size 16TiB if it
                            doesn't exist. Naming convention for default FPG is DockerFpg_n where n is an integer
                            starting from 0.
-o size=x                 x is the size of the share in GiB. By default, it is 1024 GiB.
-o help -o filePersona    When used together, these options display this help content
-o help=backends -o filePersona  When used togther, these options display status of the backends configured for File Persona
-o fsOwner=x              x is the user id and group id that should own the root directory  of nfs file share in the form of
                            [userId:groupId]. Administartor also need to make sure that local user and local group with these
                            ids are present on 3PAR before trying to mount the created share.
                            For such shares which has userId and groupId specified, mount will succeed only if users and
                            group with specified ids are present on 3PAR.
-o fsMode=x               x is 1 to 4 octal degits that represent the file mode to be applied to the root directory of the
                            file system. Ex: fsMode="0754" , Here 0 before number is mandatory. This ensures specified user
                            of fsOwner will have rwx permissions, group will have rx permissions and others will have read
                            permissions.
                          x can also be ACL string. This also represents ACL permissions that are allowed on share directory.
                            fsMode contains list of ACEs. Use Commas to seperate ACEs. Each ACE here contains 3 values named,
                            type, flag and permissions. These 3 values are seperated by ':'. First ACE represents Owner,
                            Second ACE represents Group and third ACE represents EveryOne. These has to be represented in
                            order. Ex: A:fd:rwa,A:g:rwaxdnNcCoy,A:fdS:DtnNcy 
                            type field can take only one of these values [A,D,U,L] 
                            flag field can take one or more of these values [f,d,p,i,S,F,g]
                            permissions field can take one or more of these values [r,w,a,x,d,D,t,T,n,N,c,C,o,y]
                            Please refer 3PAR cli user guide more details on meaning of each flag.
                          Note: For fsMode values user can specify either of mode bits or ACL string. Both can not be used 
                            simultaneously. While using fsMode it is mandatory to specify fsOwner. If Only fsMode is used
                            User will not be able to mount the share. This is because permissions and ownership changes are
                            done during the first mount call.
