# Secrets Management #

This section describes the steps that need to be taken in order to use secrets in encrypted format rather than plain text.

### Using Encryption utility

To encrypt the password user need to use a python package, "py-3parencryptor".
This package can be installed using the below command on linux machine

````
$ pip install py-3parencryptor

````

#### Pre-requisite

- hpe.conf should be present in /etc/hpedockerplugin/ path with etcd details in it.
- etcd should be running
- 3PAR plugin should be disabled

#### About the package

When py-3parencryptor is installed on machine. It can be used with the help of hpe3parencryptor command like below.
You have to  use the same passphrase to encrypt all the passwords for a backend.
There can be 4 possible password:
1. hpe3par_password
2. san_password  
3. hpe3par_password for replication array
4. san_password for replication array.

After generating the password replace the password with encrypted one.

````
#hpe3parencryptor -a <passphrase> <password>

Example: 

#hpe3parencryptor -a "@123#" "password"
SUCCESSFUL: Encrypted password: +CB1E8Je1j8=

````
#### Add the encrypted password in /etc/hpedockerplugin/hpe.conf

Use the encrypted password generated by utility as hpe3par_password in hpe.conf 

enable the plugin now

#### Running the utility with -d option
 If user wants to remove the current encrypted password and replace it with plain text or new encrypted password,
user need to delete the current password by using -d option in the utility.

````
# hpe3parencryptor -d
Key Successfully deleted
````
## For Multiple backend

### Encrypting a specific backend
- When multiple backend present in the configuration file(hpe.conf). User can use the utility to encrypt the password on backend basis.
- With --backend option user can provide the backend for which backend they want to encrypt the passwords.

````
#hpe3parencryptor -a <passphrase> <password> --backend <backend_name>

````
### Removing encrypted password from a specific backend

Users can remove the encrypted password of a specific backend. Users can use the utility to delete that.
There is an additional optional argument with -d, --backend.

````
# hpe3parencryptor -d --backend <backend_name>

````

#### Note : 
````
If --backend is not used, in both the case (-a and -d), package will take the default backend for performing the operations.
