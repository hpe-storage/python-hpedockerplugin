## Usage
The following are the currently supported actions that can be taken using the HPE Docker plugin.

#### Creating an HPE volume

```
docker volume create -d hpe --name <vol_name>
```

There are several optional parameters that can be used during volume creation:

- size -- specifies the desired size in GB of the volume.
- cpg -- specifes the cpg for a volume.
- snpcpg -- specifies the snap cpg for a volume.
- provisioning -- specifies the type of provisioning to use (thin, full, dedup).
- flash-cache -- specifies whether flash cache should be used or not (True, False).
- fsMode -- Represent the file mode to be applied to the root directory of the filesystem, in the form of octall digits.
- fsOwner -- Represent user id and group id that should own the root directory of the filesystem,
in the form of [userId:groupId]
- mountConflictDelay -- specifies period in seconds. This parameter is used to wait for a
mounted volume to gracefully unmount from some node before it can be mounted on the current
node. If graceful unmount doesn't happen within mountConflictDelay seconds then a forced
cleanup of VLUN from the backend is performed so that volume can be mounted on the current
node.
Note: Setting flash-cache to True does not gurantee flash-cache will be used. The backend system
must have the appropriate SSD setup configured, too.

The following is an example call creating a full provisioned, 50 GB volume:

```
docker volume create -d hpe --name <vol_name> -o size=50 -o provisioning=full
```

Note -- The dedup provisioning and flash-cache options are only supported by the
3PAR StoreServ driver currently.


#### Creating a volume using cpg and snapcpg

```
docker volume create -d hpe --name <target_vol_name> -o cpg=<cpg_name> -o snapcpg=<snapcpg_name>
```
Note -- 'cpg & snapcpg' should be present in 3par


#### Creating a volume using existing QOS

```
docker volume create -d hpe --name <target_vol_name> -o qos-name=<vvset_name>
```
Note -- 'vvset_name' should be present in 3par

#### Managing a legacy volume & snapshot

```
docker volume create -d hpe --name <target_vol_name> -o importVol=<3par_volume|3par_snapshot>
```

#### Deleting a volume

```
docker volume rm <vol_name>
```

#### List volumes

```
docker volume ls
```

#### Inspect a volume

```
docker volume inspect <vol_name>
```

#### Creating a clone of a volume

```
docker volume create -d hpe --name <target_vol_name> -o cloneOf=<source_vol_name>
```
#### Creating compressed volume

```
docker volume create -d hpe --name <target_vol_name> -o compression=true
```


#### Creating a snapshot or virtualcopy of a volume

```
docker volume create -d hpe --name <snapshot_name> -o virtualCopyOf=<source_vol_name>
```
There are couple of optional parameters that can be used during snapshot creation:
- expirationHours -- specifies the expiration time for snapshot in hours
- retentionHours  -- specifies the retention time for snapshot in hours

Note:1. If snapcpg is not configured in hpe.conf then cpg would be used for snapshot.
     2. expirationHours and retentionHours are valid attributes of a volume but 2.1
        plugin ignores these parameters and are valid only for snapshots currently.

#### Inspect a snapshot

```
docker volume inspect <snapshot_name>
```

#### Delete a snapshot

```
docker volume rm <snapshot_name>
```

#### Mounting a volume/snapshot

Use the following command to mount a volume and start a bash prompt:

```
docker run -it -v <vol_name>:/<mount_point>/ --volume-driver hpe <image_name> bash
```

Note: If the volume does not exist it will be created.
<vol_name> here can be both snapshot (or) a base volume created by the plugin.

The image used for mounting can be any image located on https://hub.docker.com/ or
the local filesystem. See https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/userguide/dockerimages/
for more details. 

#### Unmounting a volume

Exiting the bash prompt will cause the volume to unmount:

```
exit
```

The volume is still associated with a container at this point.

Run the following command to get the container ID associated with the volume:

```
docker ps -a
```

Then stop the container:

```
docker stop <container_id>
```

Next, delete the container:

```
docker rm <container_id>
```

Finally, remove the volume:

```
docker volume rm <vol_name>
```

Note: Same approch similar to volume mount is used for mounting a snapshot to a container.

#### Providing File Permission and File Owner to a Volume.

Use the below command to give ownership to a non-root user by providing UID and GID.
````
docker volume create -d hpe --name <vol_name> -o size=<vol_size> -o fsOwner=<userID:groupId>
````

Use the below command to change the mode.
````
docker volume create -d hpe --name <vol_name> -o size=<vol_size> -o fsMode=<file_mode>
````
<file_mode> is 1 to 4 octal digits that represent the file mode to be applied.
