# Automated Installer for 3PAR Docker Volume plugin (Ansible)

These are Ansible playbooks to automate the install of the HPE 3PAR Docker Volume Plug-in for Docker for use within standalone docker environment or Kubernetes/OpenShift environments.

>**NOTE:** The Ansible installer only supports Ubuntu/RHEL/CentOS. If you are using another distribution of Linux, you will need to modify the playbooks to support your application manager (apt, etc.) and the pre-requisite packages.

### Getting Started

These playbooks perform the following tasks on the Master/Worker nodes as defined in the Ansible [hosts](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/hosts) file.
* Configure the Docker Services for the HPE 3PAR Docker Volume Plug-in
* Deploys the config files (iSCSI or FC) to support your environment
* Installs the HPE 3PAR Docker Volume Plug-in (Containerized version)
* For standalone docker environment,
  * Deploys an etcd cluster
* For Kubernetes/OpenShift, 
  * Deploys a Highly Available etcd cluster used by the HPE 3PAR Docker Volume plugin 
    * Supports single node (Use only for testing purposes) or multi-node deployment (HA) as defined in the Ansible hosts file
  * Deploys the HPE FlexVolume Driver

### Prerequisites:
  - Install Ansible 2.5 or above as per [Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

  - Login to 3PAR via SSH to create entry in /\<user>\/.ssh/known_hosts file
  > **Note:** Entries for the Master and Worker nodes should already exist within the /\<user>\/.ssh/known_hosts file from the OpenShift installation. If not, you will need to log into each of the Master and Worker nodes as well to prevent connection errors from Ansible.
  
  - Clone the python-hpedockerplugin repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-hpedockerplugin
    cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
    ```
  
  - Add [plugin configuration properties - sample](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/properties/plugin_configuration_properties_sample.yml) at `properties/plugin_configuration_properties.yml` based on your HPE 3PAR Storage array configuration. Some of the properties are mandatory and must be specified in the properties file while others are optional.

  - Adding multiple backends in [plugin configuration properties - sample](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/properties/plugin_configuration_properties_sample.yml)
    Below is the table of all possible default configurations along with the installer plugin behavior column for each combination:
    BLOCK points to the hpedockerplugin_driver, hpedockerplugin.hpe.hpe_3par_iscsi.HPE3PARISCSIDriver OR hpedockerplugin.hpe.hpe_3par_fc.HPE3PARFCDriver
    FILE points to the hpedockerplugin_driver, hpedockerplugin.hpe.hpe_3par_file.HPE3PARFileDriver

      |DEFAULT | DEFAULT_BLOCK | DEFAULT_FILE | INSTALLER BEHAVIOR        |
      |--------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
      |BLOCK   |--             |--            | Plugin successfully installs.|
      |FILE    |--             |--            | Plugin successfully installs.|
      |--      |BLOCK |-- |DEFAULT backend is mandatory.Plugin installation fails in this case.|
      |--      |-- |FILE |DEFAULT backend is mandatory.Plugin installation fails in this case.|
      |BLOCK   |-- |FILE |Plugin successfully installs.|
      |FILE    |BLOCK |-- |Plugin successfully installs.|
      |BLOCK   |BLOCK |FILE |When we have DEFAULT backend with Block driver, then there should not be any DEFAULT_BLOCK backend in multibackend configuration.Plugin installation fails in this case.|
      |FILE    |BLOCK |FILE |When we have DEFAULT backend with File driver, then there should not be any DEFAULT_FILE backend in multibackend configuration.Plugin installation fails in this case.|
      |BLOCK   |FILE |--  |DEFAULT_BLOCK is not allowed to be configured for File driver. Plugin installation fails in this case.|
      |FILE   |-- |BLOCK  |DEFAULT_FILE is not allowed to be configured for Block driver. Plugin installation fails in this case.|
      |BLOCK   |BLOCK |-- |When we have DEFAULT backend with Block driver, then there should not be any DEFAULT_BLOCK backend in single backend configuration.Plugin installation fails in this case.|
      |FILE    |-- |FILE |When we have DEFAULT backend with File driver, then there should not be any DEFAULT_FILE backend in single backend configuration.Plugin installation fails in this case.|

  - The Etcd ports can be modified in [etcd cluster properties](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/properties/etcd_cluster_properties.yml) as follows:
  
      | Property  | Mandatory | Default Value |
      | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
      | ```etcd_peer_port```  | Yes  | 23800  |
      | ```etcd_client_port_1```  | Yes  | 23790 |
      | ```etcd_client_port_2```  | Yes  | 40010 |
      
    > **Note:** Please ensure that the ports specified above are unoccupied before installation. If the ports are not available on a particular node, etcd installation will fail.
    
    > **Limitation:** The installer, in the current state does not have the capability to add or remove nodes in the etcd cluster. In case an etcd node is not responding or goes down, it is beyond the current scope to admit it back into the cluster. Please follow the [etcd documentation](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/etcd-live-cluster-reconfiguration.html) to do so manually.
    
  - It is recommended that the properties file is [encrypted using Ansible Vault](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/encrypt_properties.md).

  - Modify [hosts](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/hosts) file to define your Master/Worker nodes as well as where you want to deploy your etcd cluster
  
### Working with proxies:

Set `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` in the [inventory hosts file](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/hosts) while installing plugin on Kubernetes/Openshift setup. For setting proxies in the standalone plugin installation, see [inventory hosts file for standalone plugin installation](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/hosts_standalone_nodes)

### Usage

Once the prerequisites are complete, run the following command:

- Fresh installation on standalone docker environment:
```
$ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts_standalone_nodes install_standalone_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

- Fresh installation on Openshift/Kubernetes environment:
```
$ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts install_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
> **Note:** ```--ask-vault-pass``` is required only when the properties file is encrypted


Once complete you will be ready to start using the HPE 3PAR Docker Volume Plug-in.

- Update the array backends in Standalone/Openshift/Kubernetes environment:
  * Modify the [plugin configuration properties - sample](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/properties/plugin_configuration_properties_sample.yml) at `properties/plugin_configuration_properties.yml` based on the updated HPE 3PAR Storage array configuration. Additional backends may be added or removed from the existing configuration. Individual attributes of the existing array configuration may also be modified.

    * Update array backend on standalone docker environment:
    ```
    $ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
    $ ansible-playbook -i hosts_standalone_nodes install_standalone_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
    ```

    * Update array backend on Openshift/Kubernetes environment:
    ```
    $ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
    $ ansible-playbook -i hosts install_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
    ```
  > **Note:** It is not recommended to change the Etcd information and array encryption password during the backend update process
 
- Upgrade the docker volume plugin
  * Modify the `volume_plugin` in [plugin configuration properties - sample](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/properties/plugin_configuration_properties_sample.yml) and point it to the latest image from docker hub
      * Update plugin on standalone docker environment:
      ```
      $ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
      $ ansible-playbook -i hosts_standalone_nodes install_standalone_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
      ```
     * Update plugin on Openshift/Kubernetes environment:
     ```
     $ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
     $ ansible-playbook -i hosts install_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
     ```
   > **Note:** 
     - Ensure that all the nodes in the cluster are present in the inventory [hosts](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/hosts) file
     - The docker volume plugin will be restarted and the user will not be able to create the volume during the process
     
   * Successful upgrade will remove the old plugin container and replace it with the new plugin container which is specified in the plugin properties file 
      
- Install docker volume plugin to additional nodes in the cluster
  * Add the new nodes in the respective sections in the inventory [hosts](/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/hosts) file
  * Only new nodes IP or hostnames must be present in the hosts file
  * Do not change the etcd hosts from the existing setup. Do not add or remove nodes in the etcd section
     
     * Install plugin on new nodes on Openshift/Kubernetes environment:
     ```
     $ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
     $ ansible-playbook -i hosts install_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
     ```
     
     * Uninstall plugin on nodes on Openshift/Kubernetes environment:
     ```
     $ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
     $ ansible-playbook -i hosts uninstall/uninstall_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
     ```
     
     * Uninstall plugin along with etcd on nodes on Openshift/Kubernetes environment:
     ```
     $ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
     $ ansible-playbook -i hosts uninstall/uninstall_hpe_3par_volume_driver_etcd.yml --ask-vault-pass
     ```

     > **Note:** This process only adds or removes docker volume plugin and/or etcd in nodes in an existing cluster. It does not add or remove nodes in Kubernetes/Openshift cluster
   * On success after adding plugin on new nodes, the additional nodes will have a running docker volume plugin container
   * On success after removing plugin from specified nodes, docker volume plugin container will be removed
     
Please refer to [Usage Guide](/docs/usage.md) on how to perform volume related actions on the standalone docker environment.

Please refer to the Kubernetes/OpenShift section in the [Usage Guide](/docs/usage.md#k8_usage) on how to create and deploy some sample SCs, PVCs, and Pods with persistent volumes using the HPE 3PAR Docker Volume Plug-in.
