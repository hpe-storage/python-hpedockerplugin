### Introduction to Containers & Orchestration
Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

OpenShift is a family of containerization software developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platformâ€”an on-premises platform as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

### Overview of HPE Volume Plugin for Docker 
The following diagram illustrates the HPE Volume Plugin for Docker configured on multiple hosts in a Docker cluster. The plugin is a part of Docker Engine Managed Plugin System.

This [SPOC](https://spock.corp.int.hpe.com/spock/utility/document.aspx?docurl=Shared%20Documents/hw/3par/3par_volume_plugin_for_docker.pdf) page shows the release-wise support matrix for HPE Docker Volume plugin.

Use Ansible Installer to install HPE 3PAR and HPE Primera Volume Plug-in for Docker. To know more about this installer, go to  [this](https://github.com/sonawane-shashikant/python-hpedockerplugin/blob/master/docs/Usage_Troubleshoot_Limitations.md#Automated-Installer-Features) link

### Quick Start - Deploy a Production Ready HPE Volume Plugin for Docker on Kubernetes/OpenShift Cluster
#### Pre-requisites
                
1. Review the [System Requirements](https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-hpedockerplugin/blob/master/docs/system-reqs.md) before installing the plugin

2. Install Ansible v2.5 to v2.8 only. Follow the [Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for more details on ansible installation.

```
pip install ansible==2.7.12
OR
yum install ansible==2.7.12
```

```
Note: This installation is subject to availability of the mentioned packages in your yum repository.
```
Verify ansible version
```
$ ansible --version
ansible 2.7.12
  config file = None
  configured module search path = [u'/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.5 (default, Aug  7 2019, 00:51:29) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39)]
```

3. Make sure the path of kubectl or oc binary is available in $PATH env variable.
4. Kubernetes/Openshift should be up and running. Check the following steps on the setup.
* Kubernetes/Openshift cluster should be up and all the nodes in Ready state
	                
```
+ $ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME              STATUS  ROLES   AGE  VERSION  INTERNAL-IP     EXTERNAL-IP  OS-IMAGE               KERNEL-VERSION              CONTAINER-RUNTIME
cssosbe01-196119  Ready   master  17d  v1.15.3  15.212.196.119  <none>       CentOS Linux 7 (Core)  3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64       docker://18.9.7
cssosbe01-196120  Ready   master  17d  v1.15.3  15.212.196.120  <none>       CentOS Linux 7 (Core)  3.10.0-1062.4.1.el7.x86_64  docker://18.9.7
cssosbe01-196121  Ready   master  17d  v1.15.3  15.212.196.121  <none>       CentOS Linux 7 (Core)  3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64       docker://18.9.7
cssosbe01-196150  Ready   <none>  17d  v1.15.3  15.212.196.150  <none>       CentOS Linux 7 (Core)  3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64       docker://18.9.7
cssosbe01-196151  Ready   <none>  17d  v1.15.3  15.212.196.151  <none>       CentOS Linux 7 (Core)  3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64       docker://18.9.7
```
```
Note: If any one node is in NotReady state follow the troubleshooting steps for 
Creating Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.
```
+ Verify the cluster info

```
$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://cssosbe01-196149.in.rdlabs.hpecorp.net:8443
coredns is running at https://cssosbe01-196149.in.rdlabs.hpecorp.net:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/coredns:dns/proxy
kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://cssosbe01-196149.in.rdlabs.hpecorp.net:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy
```
+ To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

5. Proxy Settings-

Set the http_proxy, https_proxy and no_proxy environment variables.
```
export http_proxy=http://<proxy server name/IP>:port_number
export https_proxy=https:// <proxy server name/IP>:port_number
export no_proxy=localhost,localaddress,.localdomain.com,.hpecorp.net,.hp.com,.hpcloud.net, <3paripaddress>,<all master/worker node ip address>
```
6. Set SSH connection with 3PAR - 

Login to 3PAR via SSH to create entry in /<user>/.ssh/known_hosts file.
```
Note: Entries for the Master and Worker nodes should already exist within the /<user>/.ssh/known_hosts 
file from the OpenShift installation. 
If not, you will need to log into each of the Master and Worker nodes as well to prevent 
connection errors from Ansible.
```
	
#### Install HPE Volume Plugin for Docker on Kubernetes/OpenShift Cluster
+ Clone the python-hpedockerplugin repository on any of the masters.
```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-hpedockerplugin
$ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin
```
+ Copy plugin configuration properties - sample at properties/plugin_configuration_properties.yml based on your HPE 3PAR Storage array configuration. Some of the properties are mandatory and must be specified in the properties file while others are optional.
```
$ cd ~
$ cd python-hpedockerplugin/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/properties
$ cp plugin_configuration_properties_sample.yml plugin_configuration_properties.yml
```
**Note:** Encrypt plugin_configuration_properties.yml using [how to encrypt properties file](https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-hpedockerplugin/blob/master/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/encrypt_properties.md) link.
+ Refer to [sample](https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-hpedockerplugin/blob/master/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/properties/plugin_configuration_properties_sample.yml) file for details which are to be updated into plugin configuration properties yaml.
+ This [Example](https://github.com/sonawane-shashikant/python-hpedockerplugin/blob/master/docs/plugin_configuration_properties_example.yml) yaml shows the example with bare minimum parameters as per requirement.
+ Set encryptor_key in properties/plugin_configuration_properties.yml for the backends to store encrypted passwords in /etc/hpedockerplugin/hpe.conf. This value shouldn't be set to empty string.
+ Modify [hosts](https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-hpedockerplugin/blob/master/ansible_3par_docker_plugin/hosts) file to define your Master/Worker nodes as well as where you want to deploy your etcd cluster.
```
Note: For the multi-master setup, define all the master nodes under the [masters] section in hosts file 
and it should be active master from where the doryd deployment is executed. 
For more information on etcd and how-to setup an etcd cluster for High Availability.
The installer, in the current state does not have the capability to add or remove nodes in the etcd cluster. 
In case an etcd node is not responding or goes down, it is beyond the current scope to admit it back into the cluster. 
Follow the etcd documentation to do so manually.
```
+ Run Installation with vault-pass
```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts install_hpe_3par_volume_driver.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
+ Installer installs etcd as a service on the nodes which are mentioned under [etcd] section of hosts file to store the plugin data.
+ Refer [etcd_cluster](https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-hpedockerplugin/blob/master/docs/advanced/etcd_cluster_setup.md) for more details.

```
Note: Ensure that the ports 23790 and 23800 are unoccupied before installation on all the nodes under [etcd] section. 
If the ports are not available on a particular node, etcd installation will fail.
If more than one node is mentioned under [etcd] section, then it will create the etcd cluster.
```
+ Refer to [Post Installation Checks](https://github.com/hpe-storage/python-hpedockerplugin/blob/master/docs/PostInstallation_checks.md) to validate successful installation of the plugin.
