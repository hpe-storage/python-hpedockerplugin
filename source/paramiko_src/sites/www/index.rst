Welcome to Paramiko!
====================

Paramiko is a Python (2.6+, 3.3+) implementation of the SSHv2 protocol [#]_,
providing both client and server functionality. While it leverages a Python C
extension for low level cryptography
(`Cryptography <https://cryptography.io>`_), Paramiko itself is a pure Python
interface around SSH networking concepts.

This website covers project information for Paramiko such as the changelog,
contribution guidelines, development roadmap, news/blog, and so forth. Detailed
usage and API documentation can be found at our code documentation site,
`docs.paramiko.org <http://docs.paramiko.org>`_.

    SSH is defined in :rfc:`4251`, :rfc:`4252`, :rfc:`4253` and :rfc:`4254`. The
    primary working implementation of the protocol is the `OpenSSH project
    <http://openssh.org>`_.  Paramiko implements a large portion of the SSH
    feature set, but there are occasional gaps.
